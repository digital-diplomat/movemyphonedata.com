        <h1>Moving Between Samsung Devices</h1>

        <p class="intro">
            A Samsung fan? Well you'll be pleased to know that not much has changed in the past couple years for Samsung
            data transfers. It's really only gotten easier! Like with any Samsung phone transfer, Samsung's
            <a href="https://www.samsung.com/us/apps/smart-switch/">Smart Switch app</a> will be your best
            friend.
        </p>

        <hr/>

        <h2>[0 : Download Smart Switch]</h2>

        <p>
            I call this step 0 because any Samsung phone since the Galaxy S8 likely has Smart Switch pre-installed. If
            not, go to the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sec.android.easyMover">Google
            Play Store</a> and download the app. Make sure it's installed on both the new <i>and</i> old phone.
        </p>

        <h2>[1 : Open Smart Switch And Follow The Prompts]</h2>

        <p>
            Samsung makes the app pretty self-explanatory. The first thing you'll see on both phones is a screen asking
            whether you're sending or receiving files. Select the appropriate option for each phone (left), select
            "Galaxy/Android" on the new phone (middle), then select the transfer medium (right).

                    title="Yes, I know the times are out of order. I almost forgot this step and had to go back to take this screenshot."
                />
            </div>

        <h3>Transferring With A Cable</h3>
        
        <p>
            Using a cable is typically fastest; you can use the USB-C to C cable that comes with your new phone (assuming
            it's a Note 10 or newer). Select "Cable" on both phones, then plug the cable into the charging port of each
            device.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the two phones don't immediately find each other, check the old phone's notifications (swipe down
            from the top of the screen) and make sure the USB connection is in File Transfer mode or MTP mode. If the
            notification says "Charging connected phone" or something else, tap the notification and choose File Transfer
            or MTP.
        </p>

        <h3>Transferring Wirelessly</h3>

        <p>
            If your old phone uses Micro-USB (Galaxy S7 or older) and you don't have an adapter, or if you prefer not to
            use a cable for some other reason (faulty charging port, just don't feel like it, etc.) then you can transfer
            wirelessly. Select "Wireless" on each phone and wait for them to find each other. If you're young or have
            really good hearing, you may notice a high-pitched "hiss" coming from the sending phone. This is how the
            phones find each other and establish the connection. If a confirmation message pops up, allow the connection.
        </p>

        <h2>[2 : Select Data to Transfer]</h2>

        <p>
            Once the devices are fully connected, the new phone will search the old phone for files that can be
            transferred. A list will then pop up asking what kinds of files you want to bring over. Transfers between
            Samsung phones are particularly robust, allowing you to transfer your entire home screen layout and app/widget
            positions!
        </p>
        <p>
            If you have a large number of text messages saved on your old phone, Smart Switch may request that you only
            bring over more recent messages. This is because compressing the messages on the old phone to send them over
            is one of the most time-consuming parts of this transfer process, sometimes taking longer than photos and
            videos combined! If your old texts are not of great import, you can skip them and only bring the newer ones.
            It may also be a good idea to back up your older messages elsewhere; there are plenty of third-party apps on
            the Google Play Store for that.
        </p>

        <h3>Note For Phones Using <i>Secure Folder</i></h3>
        
        <p>
            For those of you with business/confidential information on your phone, Smart Switch <i>does</i> give you the
            option to move your Secure Folder items over. This process is very similar to the process above, with one
            key difference: you <i>must</i> create an encryption password for your data, which you will enter on the new
            phone once the transfer is complete. <em>DO NOT FORGET THIS PASSWORD,</em> unless you enjoy losing all of
            that important data.
        </p>

        <h2>[3 : Wait For The Transfer To Complete</h2>
        
        <p>
            A Smart Switch data transfer goes through two different phases: moving your data over, and organizing that
            data once it's all on the new phone. I'll go over each phase in more depth.
        </p>

        <h3>
            Phase 1 - Transferring
        </h3>
        <p>
            During this phase, the old phone will show a continuous "transferring" message, while the new phone will show
            two important bits of information: a percentage, indicating how far along the process is, and an indicator
            saying what exactly is being transferred at that point. The percentage is not a particularly good indicator
            of time remaining, as different steps in the transfer process take different lengths of time. The "Time
            Remaining" indicator also isn't particularly accurate; assume the process will take 10-15 minutes longer than
            the indicator says.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the transfer appears to be hung up on preparing messages data or moving app data, <i>don't panic</i>! This
            is typical behavior. The process typically pushes forward pretty quickly after each of these steps. Once the
            percentage hits 100%, it's time for...
        </p>

        <h3>
            Phase 2 - Organizing
        </h3>
        <p>
            At this point, all of the data is transferred to the new phone. If you used a cable for the transfer, you
            can disconnect it now. However, you won't notice any changes to the new phone yet, and your photos, contacts,
            and home screen layout may not show up just yet. Why? Because the new phone needs to take all the data it
            just received and put it in its proper place. This process usually takes around 10 minutes, depending on what
            all was transferred.
        </p>
        <p>
            While you're waiting for your data to organize, feel free to try out your brand new phone; it's ready to use!
        </p>

        <h2>[4 : Double Check and Enjoy Your New Phone!]</h2>

        <p>
            Once you get the notification that your data is done organizing, take a minute to look at your home screen,
            photos, contacts, and any other memos. Verify that everything is in its proper place. A lot of your apps will
            be grayed out at first. Don't worry though, they're just being reinstalled on the new phone. Once you've
            verified that everything is there, you're pretty much done. Log back into any web-based apps and enjoy your
            brand new phone! :]
        </p>
